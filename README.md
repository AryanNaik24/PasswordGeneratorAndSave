# Password Generator

## Description
This is a simple Python-based password generator that creates secure passwords based on user-defined length and character set preferences. The script allows users to choose between generating passwords with only alphabets and numbers or including special characters for added security. Users can also save their generated passwords in a text file for future reference.

## Features
- Generates strong passwords of user-specified length
- Option to include special characters (`!@$%&`)
- Saves generated passwords to a text file
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
3. Enter the desired password length.
4. Choose the type of password:
   - `1` for alphabets and numbers only
   - `2` for alphabets, numbers, and symbols
5. The script will generate a password and display it.
6. Optionally, you can save the password to a file (`definatlynotpass.txt`).

## Future Improvements
- GUI version for easier usage
- Enhanced security features (e.g., password strength indicator)
